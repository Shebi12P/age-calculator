# Project name

Age calculator

# Project description

It's a solution for the Frontend Mentor - Age calculator (https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/age-calculator-app-dF9DFFpj-Q). The app calculates the day, month and year difference between today and
provided date by the user.

## The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - Any field has non-numeric values
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
